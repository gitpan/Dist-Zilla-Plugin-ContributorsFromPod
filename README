NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ContributorsFromPod - Populate meta x_contributors
    from CONTRIBUTORS POD in the dist

SYNOPSIS
    in dist.ini:

      [ContributorsFromPod]

DESCRIPTION
    If you have a

      =head1 CONTRIBUTORS

    section in your main file in your distribution, this Dist::Zilla plugin
    will populate your META.json x_contributors list from it.

    The format should be:

      Some Name <some@email.com>

    nicknames are also supported:

      ircnick: Some Name <some@email.com>

    NOTE: the word "CONTRIBUTORS" must be in upper case, and the following
    "=head1" section must also be in upper case. "CONTRIBUTORS" being the
    last "=head1" section is also fine. This is because we use a regex to
    parse out the list from Pod::Text.
